# lil_waaaves_sqrt-PI
a video mixer, framebuffer delay, and feedback resynthesis engine built in openFrameworks https://openframeworks.cc/

OK! so installing from these files here on the github are kind of only for folks reasonably well versed in navigating openFrameworks already! I can't really help anyone out anymore with this sort of thing as the volume of requests has greatly outpaced the amount of time I can afford to spend on that! But for everyone who has no idea what the heck an open frame work is don't worry I jurry rigged a reasonable solution for yalls! Download the zip here (osx only) https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a2TScyK68Qm4_pSTsc3hG2fPHbgm-uLf, unzip and follow the instructions in the txt file named "(()))00ReadThisTextFile!" and have fun!

here is a version which i am working on for windows https://drive.google.com/open?id=11PUoCzV10ZMobP1pHeaBF79tpfTkrXbN !  requires you to follow the steps on this page https://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/ , after that is finished unzip the folder from my drive and then navigate to apps->myApps->lil_waaaves_IMguitest_nosyphon.vcxproj double click and then when the visual studio ide loads up press the play button near the top middle of the window and have fun!

if you have never used oF and/or Xcode before here are some troubleshooting tips to try before contacting me
1. the entire folder structure needs to be intact and moved into the apps/myApps folder within the openframeworks folder
2. try running project generator and importing this folder (with the abovementioned addons) if theres still errors
3. https://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/ has some advice on how to troubleshoot troublesome addons as well so check this out too!

numereous secret keyboard commands
to scale syphon input press[] and ;/

to rotate and shift framebuffer xyz positions a,z,s,x,d,c,f,v,g,b,h,n,t,y can all be used, the numerical key '3' resets all positions

the numerical key '1'clears the framebuffer
